TICK TACK TOE

Two players take turns marking grid w/ their symbol
Once a player gets three of their marks aligned across, above, or diagonally they win
If no player gets three in a row, it's a tie

     a   b   c
     m | m | m 
1   ___|___|___
     m | m | m
2   ___|___|___
     m | m | m
3      |   |

- Utilize a dictionary to keep track of grid markings?

player_1 {
    mark: 'X',
    turn: True,
    winner: False,
}

grid = {
    'a1': " ",
    'a2': " ",
    'a3': " ",
    'b1': " ",
    'b2': " ",
    'b3': " ",
    'c1': " ",
    'c2': " ",
    'c3': " "
}

def generate_grid():
    """ function to generate grid each time w/ logged markings?? """
   table = """
         a   b   c
         {grid['a1']} | {grid['a2']} | {grid['a3']}

    print(table)


TODO: Eventually make a play_again function that will clear game data
      or end game. 

BUG: Didn't catch win ['a1', 'b2', 'c3']
     - if it's out of order or there's 'superfluous' data it doesn't track a win...
